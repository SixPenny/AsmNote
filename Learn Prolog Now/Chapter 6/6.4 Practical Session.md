1. It is possible to write a one line definition of the member predicate by making use of append/3 . Do so. How does this new version of member compare in efficiency with the standard one?
```
member(X, List) :- append(_, [X|_], List).
```
2. Write a predicate set(InList,OutList) which takes as input an arbitrary list, and returns a list in which each element of the input list appears only once. For example, the query
```
   set([2,2,foo,1,foo,  [],[]],X).
should yield the result

   
   X  =  [2,foo,1,[]].
```
(Hint: use the member predicate to test for repetitions of items you have already found.)

```prolog
set(List, Set) :- setAcc(List, [], Set).

setAcc([], X, X).
setAcc([H|T], A, R) :- 
    \+member(H, A),
    setAcc(T, [H|A], R).
setAcc([H|T], A, R) :- 
    member(H, A),
    setAcc(T, A, R).
```

3. We ‘flatten’ a list by removing all the square brackets around any lists it contains as elements, and around any lists that its elements contain as elements, and so on, for all nested lists. For example, when we flatten the list
```
[a,b,[c,d],[[1,2]],foo]
```
we get the list

    [a,b,c,d,1,2,foo]
and when we flatten the list

    [a,b,[[[[[[[c,d]]]]]]],[[1,2]],foo,[]]
we also get

    [a,b,c,d,1,2,foo].
Write a predicate flatten(List,Flat) that holds when the first argument List flattens to the second argument Flat . This should be done without making use of append/3 .

```
flatten(List, Flat) :- flattenAcc(List, [], Flat).

flattenAcc([], A, A).
flattenAcc(X, A, [X|A]) :- 
    X \= [],
    X \= [_|_].
flattenAcc([H|T], A, R) :- 
    flattenAcc(T, A, G),
    flattenAcc(H, G, R).
```
