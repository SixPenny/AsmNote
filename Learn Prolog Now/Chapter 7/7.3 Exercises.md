## Exercise  7.1 
Suppose we are working with the following DCG:
```
s  -->  foo,bar,wiggle.
foo  -->  [choo].
foo  -->  foo,foo.
bar  -->  mar,zar.
mar  -->  me,my.
me  -->  [i].
my  -->  [am].
zar  -->  blar,car.
blar  -->  [a].
car  -->  [train].
wiggle  -->  [toot].
wiggle  -->  wiggle,wiggle.
```
Write down the ordinary Prolog rules that correspond to these DCG rules. What are the first three responses that Prolog gives to the query s(X,[]) ?
```
s(A, B) :- foo(A, C), bar(C, D), wiggle(D, B).
foo([choo|A], A).
foo(A, B) :- foo(A, C), foo(C, B).
bar(A, B) :- mar(A, C), zar(C, B).
mar(A, B) :- me(A, C), my(C, B).
me([i|A], A).
my([am|A], A).
zar(A, B) :- blar(A, C), car(C, B).
blar([a|A], A).
car([train|A], A).
wiggle([toot|A], A).
wiggle(A, B) :- wiggle(A, C), wiggle(C, B).

[choo, i, am, a, train, toot]
```

## Exercise  7.2 
The formal language a^n b^n −{ ϵ } consists of all the strings in a^n b^n except the empty string. Write a DCG that generates this language.

```
s --> l, r
s --> l, s, r.
l --> [a].
r --> [b].
```

## Exercise  7.3 
Let a^n b^2n be the formal language which contains all strings of the following form: an unbroken block of a s of length n followed by an unbroken block of b s of length 2n , and nothing else. For example, abb , aabbbb , and aaabbbbbb belong to a n b 2 n , and so does the empty string. Write a DCG that generates this language.

```
s --> [].
s --> l, s, r, r.
l --> [a].
r --> [b].
```
