## 1
Define a predicate nu/2 (”not unifiable”) which takes two terms as arguments and succeeds if the two terms do not unify. For example:
```
nu(foo,foo).
no

nu  (foo,blob).
yes

nu(foo,X).
no
```
You should define this predicate in three different ways:

1. First (and easiest) write it with the help of = and `\+ `.
2. Second write it with the help of = , but don’t use `\+` .
3. Third, write it using a cut-fail combination. Don’t use = and don’t use `\+` .

```
1. nu(X, Y) :- \+X=Y.
2. nu(X, Y) :- X=Y, ! fail.
   nu(_, _).
3. nu(X, X) :- ! fail.
   nu(_, _).
```
## 2
Define a predicate unifiable(List1,Term,List2) where List2 is the list of all members of List1 that unify with Term . The elements of List2 should not be instantiated by the unification. For example
```
unifiable([X,b,t(Y)],t(a),List]
```
should yield

           List  =  [X,t(Y)].
Note that X and Y are still not instantiated. So the tricky part is: how do we check that they unify with t(a) without instantiating them?

(Hint: consider using tests of the form `\+  term1  =  term2` . Why? Think about it. You might also like to think about tests of the form `\+ \+  term1  =  term2` .)

```
unifiable([T|List1], Term, List2) :- 
    \+ T=Term,
    !,
    unifiable(List1, Term, List2).
unifiable([H|List1], Term, [H|List2]) :-
    unifiable(List1, Term, List2).
unifiable([], Term, []).
```
