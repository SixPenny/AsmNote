## Exercise  12.1 
Write code that creates hogwart.houses , a file that that looks like this:
```
            gryffindor
   hufflepuff       ravenclaw
            slytherin
```
You can use the built-in predicates open/3 , close/1 , tab/2 , nl/1 , and write/2 .

```
main :- 
    open('hogwart.houses', write, Stream),
    tab(Stream, 3),
    write(Stream, 'gryffindor'),
    nl(Stream),tab(Stream, 1),
    write(Stream, 'hufflepuff'),
    tab(Stream, 1),
    write(Stream, 'ravenclaw'),
    nl(Stream),
    tab(Stream, 3),
    write(Stream, 'slytherin'),
    close(Stream).
```
## Exercise  12.2
Write a Prolog program that reads in a plain text file word by word, and asserts all read words and their frequency into the Prolog database. You may use the predicate readWord/2 to read in words. Use a dynamic predicate word/2 to store the words, where the first argument is a word, and the second argument is the frequency of that word.

```
:- dynamic word/2.

wordfrequency(X) :-
    open(X, read, Stream),
    readWord(Stream, Word),
    addwordfre(Word).
addwordfre(Word) :- 
    word(Word, N),
    NN is N + 1,
    retract(word(Word, N)).
    assert(word(Word, NN)).
addwordfre(Word) :-
    \+word(Word, _), 
    assert(word(Word, 1)).

```
