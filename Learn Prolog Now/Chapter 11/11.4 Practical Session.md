## set
Sets can be thought of as lists that don’t contain any repeated elements. For example, [a,4,6] is a set, but [a,4,6,a] is not (as it contains two occurrences of a) . Write a Prolog program subset/2 that is satisfied when the first argument is a subset of the second argument (that is, when every element of the first argument is a member of the second argument). For example:
```
   ?-  subset([a,b],[a,b,c])
   yes
   
   ?-  subset([c,b],[a,b,c])
   yes
   
   ?-  subset([],[a,b,c])
   yes
```
Your program should be capable of generating all subsets of an input set by backtracking. For example, if you give it as input

    ?-  subset(X,[a,b,c])
it should successively generate all eight subsets of [a,b,c] .
```
subset(X, Y) :-
    var(X),
    subset_gen(X, Y).
subset(X, Y) :-
    nonvar(X),
    subset_check(X, Y).
    
subset_check([], []).
subset_check([], [_|_]).
subset_check([H|T], List) :- 
    member(H, List),
    subset(T, List).
    
subset_gen([], []).
subset_gen(S, [_ |Set]) :- subset_gen(S, Set).
subset_gen([H|S], [H|Set]) :- subset_gen(S, Set).
```

## powerset
Using the subset predicate you have just written, and findall/3 , write a predicate powerset/2 that takes a set as its first argument, and returns the powerset of this set as the second argument. (The powerset of a set is the set of all its subsets.) For example:

    ?-  powerset([a,b,c],P)
should return

    P  =  [[],[a],[b],[c],[a,b],[a,c],[b,c],[a,b,c]]
It doesn’t matter if the sets are returned in some other order. For example,

    P  =  [[a],[b],[c],[a,b,c],[],[a,b],[a,c],[b,c]]
is fine too.

```
powerset(X, Y) :-
    findall(Subset, subset(Subset, X), Y).
```
